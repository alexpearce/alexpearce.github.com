## Building

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a JavaScript-based static site generator.

Before building, install npm and then install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Generate the site with:

```
npm run-script build
```

The `serve` command can be used instead of `build` to start a auto-reloading
web server.

Comment threads are made as GitHub issues. You can comment directly on the site
at the bottom of each post, or on [an existing issue on GitHub][issues] if one
exists.
