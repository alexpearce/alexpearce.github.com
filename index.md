I am physicist and a coder. I spend a lot of time writing computer programs 
that try to answer questions about data.

I work as a PhD student in experimental particle physics at the [University of 
Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), making measurements using data 
produced at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](https://home.cern/).

When I make something useful, which is less often than I'd like, I put it on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/alexpearce), and when I solve a problem that others 
might have I write about it on my [blog](/blog).

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hello) if you have 
any questions.
