I am a physicist and a coder. I spend a lot of time writing computer programs
that try to answer questions about data.

I work as a member of the research staff at CERN on the [LHCb
experiment](https://lhcb.cern.ch), making measurements using data produced at
the Large Hadron Collider.

When I make something useful, which is less often than I'd like, I put it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/alexpearce), and when I solve a problem that others
might have I write about it on my [blog](/blog).

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hello) if you have
any questions.
